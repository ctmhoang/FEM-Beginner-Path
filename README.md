## About this course
More than an introduction, in this course youâ€™ll go from building your first website to having the foundation for becoming a professional web developer with modern skills! By coding along in this course, you'll get experience writing HTML, the primary language for putting content on a page. CSS, a language designed to make your websites look tidy and aesthetically pleasing. And learn how to program, starting with a wonderful language to learn with, JavaScript. After this whirlwind tour of web development, you'll know how to write code with HTML, CSS & JavaScript. You'll learn to use your terminal to save your code with Git and as a small bonus primer, you'll get a taste of how to use JavaScript via Node.js to serve your website from a server!
